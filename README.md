🎮Rock-Paper-Scissors Game 🎮

This Python code lets you play the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against a virtual opponent (the computer). Here’s how it works:

Choose Your Weapon:
You can pick from three options:
Rock 🪨
Paper 📄
Scissors ✂️
Each option is displayed with a fun emoji to make the game more enjoyable.


How the Game Decides Who Wins:

The game checks what you and the computer chose.
If both of you choose the same option, it’s a tie! 🤝

If not, the game follows these simple rules:
Rock 🪨 beats Scissors ✂️
Paper 📄 beats Rock 🪨
Scissors ✂️ beat Paper 📄
The game will then tell you whether you won or lost in a fun and friendly way.

Playing the Game:
First, you enter your name and give a name to the computer opponent.
Then, you pick your choice from the options (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
The computer also makes a choice, and the game shows both choices on the screen.
Finally, the game announces the winner!

Exiting the Game:
If you want to stop playing, just choose the "Exit 🚪" option, and the game will say goodbye 👋.
